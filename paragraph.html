<!--Here are the headers and paragraph information.-->
<body>
<!--This is header 1 which is a big text size-->
    <h1>How to find a date</h1>
<!--This is header 2 which is a smaller text size that includes a paragraph-->
    <h2>Hang out in places with people your own age</h2>
        <p>You’ll have a better chance of meeting someone if you’re out and about. <br>
            If you’re old enough, you could try going to a bar or a club. <br>
            If that isn’t really your scene, hit up a coffee shop or a bookstore nearby. <br>
            You could also try joining a book club or a hobby club to meet people interested in the same things as you.<br></p>
<!--This is header 3 which is even smaller text size that includes a paragraph-->
    <h3>Ask a friend or family member to set you up with someone.</h3>
    <p>Your loved ones might know someone else who is single. 
        If you feel comfortable, you can ask them to pass on your name or number and potentially set up a date. <br>
        Your friends and family probably know you well, so they should be able to pick someone who is right for you. <br>
        Setups like this are often called "blind dates," and they can be a little nerve wracking. <br>
        However, they’re a great way to guarantee a date!</p>
<!--This is header 4 which is even a smaller text size that includes a paragraph-->
    <h4>Strike up a conversation with a stranger.</h4>
    <p>Pick a good opening line to keep your potential date’s interest. <br>
        Try looking for something around you that you could talk about, like books in a book store or produce in a supermarket. <br>
        It doesn’t have to be groundbreaking; just something that you two can talk about for a few minutes<br></h3></p>
